# Various-User-Interactive-Programs-in-C
This project consists of four distinct user-interactive programs designed to perform various tasks based on user inputs. Each program is encapsulated in its own function:

Perfect Square:

● Objective: Draws a hollow square of asterisks of a user-defined size.

● Implementation: Uses nested loops to print the outline of the square, ensuring spaces inside to keep it hollow.

Elevator:

● Objective: Simulates an elevator ride where the user can choose floors.

● Implementation: Utilizes a switch statement to display messages for each floor, with a while loop to continuously prompt until the user chooses to exit.

Pyramid:

● Objective: Prints a pyramid of dashes with a user-defined number of steps.

● Implementation: Uses nested loops to create the pyramid structure, first incrementing and then decrementing the number of dashes per line.

Class Average Calculation:

● Objective: Computes the average score of a class based on user input of student grades.

● Implementation: Uses a loop to gather grades, validate them, and calculate the average.
